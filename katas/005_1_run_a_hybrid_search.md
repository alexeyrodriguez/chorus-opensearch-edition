# Kata 005: Why am I getting Printer toner for printer pages (???)

PREAMBLE.

To run this Kata, we're trying something new, we're going to use a Jupyter Notebook as there are a lot of commands to run.

To get started you need to have a recent Python version.

1. Open a terminal and change to the katas directory: `cd ./katas`

1. We're going to use a "Virtual Environment" to organize everything: `python3 -m venv .venv`

1. Now start up the env: `source .venv/bin/activate`

1. Lastly, install all the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Great!  You are all set up.   Now to fire up the Jupyter notebook run

```bash
$ jupyter notebook 005_2_run_a_hybrid_search.ipynb
```
