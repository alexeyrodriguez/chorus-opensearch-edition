# Kata x:  Import pre-existing event data

Note: although this data should index to the indices in the file format, it's best to make sure the UBI store(s) for the indices exist with the following:

`curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:9200/_plugins/ubi/`{<mark>ubi-store-name}</mark>`?index=`{<mark>search-index</mark>}`&id_field=`{<mark>unique-key-field</mark>}

Where:
- *ubi-store-name* is the name of the UBI store.  So, for the ubi store name, `ubi-awesome`, the subsequent indices should be named `.ubi-awesome_events` and `.ubi-awesome_queries`.  **This allows integrates the data you're loading with the UBI store.** 
- *search-index* is the index the user will search against (i.e. products, books, blogs, etc.). **This is what activates a listener on that index to log all user queries on the search-index into the `.ubi-awesome_queries` index**
- *unique-key-field* is a unique field in the search-index that can link back to the exact row. **This is what allows a query at some point in time link to a *hit* that the user acted on (i.e. purchase, like, etc.)**
